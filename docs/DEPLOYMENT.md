# Deployment & Verification Checklist

Use this guide to confirm the ProList Mini buyer follower experience is ready for production and to smoke-test the key user flows after deployment.

## 1. Environment prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+ installed.
- Ensure the `VITE_BASE_PATH` (or `BASE_PATH`) environment variable is set if the app is hosted from a sub-path. The Vite config automatically infers the base path for GitHub Pages deployments when the variable is omitted.【F:vite.config.ts†L8-L34】

## 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
> **Troubleshooting:** If your environment blocks requests to `registry.npmjs.org`, mirror the dependencies or run the install step in an environment with npm registry access. Without `node_modules`, subsequent build steps will fail.

## 3. Quality gates
Run these commands before deploying:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```
- `npm run lint` executes ESLint across the project using the rules defined in `eslint.config.js`.
- `npm run build` compiles the PWA with Vite, including the service worker and manifest generated by `vite-plugin-pwa` so offline caching is active in production.【F:vite.config.ts†L36-L69】

To preview the production build locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```
This starts the Vite preview server on port 4173 by default.

## 4. Feature smoke tests
After the build is deployed, walk through these checks:

1. **Buyer Following tab** – Navigate to the Following workspace and switch between the "Discover", "Following", and "Followers" tabs. The UI should render the seeded creators grid, followed list, and buyer followers respectively.【F:src/components/followers/FollowingTab.tsx†L1-L33】【F:src/components/followers/DiscoverCreators.tsx†L1-L82】【F:src/components/followers/Followers.tsx†L1-L88】
2. **Follow/unfollow & notifications** – Follow a creator, toggle auction/preorder notifications, and open the notification sheet to confirm persistence and toast feedback.【F:src/components/followers/DiscoverCreators.tsx†L14-L73】【F:src/components/followers/MyFollows.tsx†L1-L116】【F:src/components/followers/NotifySheet.tsx†L1-L76】
3. **Privacy toggles** – From the Profile preferences card, adjust the buyer/importer privacy switches and confirm the toggles save back to local storage.【F:src/pages/Profile.tsx†L1528-L1567】
4. **Demo data persistence** – Refresh the page to confirm follows, notification settings, and privacy choices remain thanks to the localStorage helpers in `followersData.ts` and profile stores.【F:src/lib/followersData.ts†L3-L112】【F:src/pages/Profile.tsx†L1074-L1118】
5. **Internationalisation** – Switch the locale between English and French and verify copy updates across the following screens.【F:src/context/I18nContext.tsx†L1-L189】
6. **Analytics tracking** – While interacting with the flows in development mode, check the console logs for analytics events triggered by the follower actions and workspace toggles.【F:src/lib/analytics.ts†L1-L109】【F:src/components/followers/MyFollows.tsx†L19-L89】【F:src/components/home/ModeToggle.tsx†L1-L33】

## 5. Resetting demo state
To reset the seeded state, clear `localStorage` keys that start with `pl.` (e.g. `pl.followers`, `pl.followers.privacy`) and the profile keys used for buyer/importer preferences.【F:src/lib/followersData.ts†L3-L112】【F:src/pages/Profile.tsx†L1074-L1118】

With these steps complete, the application is ready for deployment and acceptance testing.
