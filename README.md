## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/c32b8551-baa1-4e5e-8244-2ae86a1229f8

## Tech stack

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript

- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- `vite-plugin-pwa`

## Getting started locally

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Useful scripts

- `npm run lint` – Run ESLint across the codebase.
- `npm run build` – Create a production build (includes the PWA service worker and manifest).
- `npm run preview` – Serve the production build locally.

> If your environment blocks `registry.npmjs.org`, mirror the dependencies or install them from a location with registry access before running the scripts above.
